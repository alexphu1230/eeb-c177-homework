1. Touch command creates a new file. Using the GUI explorer the file does show up
2. the file is 0 bytes
3. We would want to create a file this way when we want to put it in a directory and make the file blank. 


Moving files to a new folder:

mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw 

Renaming Files 

1. No because the old file would still exist.
2. Yes this would work
3. No this would not work because there is no file name 
4. No this would not work because there is no final destination for the file. 

Moving and Copying 

1. no because the file is located in a different place 
2. Yes
3. No because the proteins.dat is located in /useres/jamie/data/recombine 
4. No because proteins-saved.dat is located in /Users/jamie 

Removing files and Directories 

All files that are deleted disappear forever but by using -i, we can check that we are deleting only the files we want. 

Copy with multiple file names:

If there are 3 or more file names, cp will result in an error because it wants a directory name. If a directory is given, than it works. 

List filenames matching a pattern:

Answer is 3

1. shows files whose names contain zero or more characters followed by the letter t, zero or more characters followed by ane.pdb 
2. This one does not work because it makes the tane files pop up so the thane files would not show up. 
3. This one works 
4. this one would only show files with the word ethane in them 

Wildcards:

cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
 cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
 cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23r

Organizing Directory:

mv. *.dat analyzed 

Reproduce a folder structure:


The first two sets would work 
The third set would not work because mkdir cannot make a directory in something that doesnt exist
the final set generates raw and processed directories in the data directory
